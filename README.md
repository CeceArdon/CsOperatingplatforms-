# CsOperatingplatforms-

The client The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose it, which is only currently available for Android.  The main idea of this game is that multiple teams are going four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is pulled from a library of images one team has to guess till time runs out. If not answered each opposing team member gets to answer till the 15-second time limit. Figure out what type of operating system will be used, the budget, and the deadline. Get more detail on the requirements.

All the details The Gaming Room wanted in the software were thoroughly documented by me. As well, I made sure to communicate the constraints and recommendations to the client, The Gaming Room. 

After going through the design document for the software, I found it helpful with the coding as it gave me a better understanding of all the tasks I would need to perform. It allowed me to fulfill all the requirements of the client.

The recommendation section is one part I would like to revise. Since this recommendation is beneficial to the client, The Gaming Room, it needs more explanations.

In order to meet the client's needs, I obtained a better understanding of the requirements that must be met for the software to function. Users' needs are a representation of their goals, values, and aspirations. A product or service must provide them with these attributes to meet the needs of consumers. A design that doesn't meet the client's needs would result in their dissatisfaction. 

Whenever I'm designing any software, I like to compare and do extensive research to find out what suits the software best. As an example, I would research similar software to get an understanding of the language, design, cost, and more of that particular software to see if it matched the client's software needs. Analyzing other software costs, maintenance, development, documentation, along with other tools and techniques is what I would do.
